# Exploratory Quick Testing
To test, use tools like Postman, or VSCode extension `ThunderClient`.
## 1. Run the Backend
```bash
cd backend/
python gateway.py
``` 
## 2.1 Select and Run the Tests
Open the `backend_test.rest` file and simply click on the "Send Request" button.

## 2.2 Edit the Tests
You can edit the HTTP request sent to the backend simply by editing the URL, method, or parameters. You can make more tests by first typing '###' on a new line, followed by another new line with the next test method and URL.
