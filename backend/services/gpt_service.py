            Each of those bits of data are a json where the attribute is the index, and the \
            corresponding value is the actual data.\
            All these are plotted against distance from the start line (labelled \'Distance\'). \
            The information on the circuit tells you where are all the corners relative to the start line\
            Using this data, I need you to identify the critical braking points, any \
            potential mistakes the driver made through the lap, and any tips for improvement. \
            Make sure those three things are always presented! Refer to the points of interest by \
            corner numbers rather than the index of the json."
